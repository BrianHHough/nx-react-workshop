### üíª Lab 11 - e2e test the shared component

###### ‚è∞ Estimated time: 5 minutes

The storybook generator we invoked earlier also generated some e2e tests. Let's try them out!

#### üìö Learning outcomes:

- Take advantage of the e2e tests Nx generated earlier to test your app

#### üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Steps:

1. Our previous command generated a new `apps/store-ui-shared-e2e` folder. Let's run them: `nx e2e store-ui-shared-e2e`
   - The tests should fail
2. Open `apps/store-ui-shared-e2e/src/integration/header/header.spec.ts` and change the test:

   ```ts
   it('should show the title', () => {
     cy.get('bg-hoard-header').contains('Board Game Hoard');
   });
   ```

3. Re-run the tests
4. Inspect what changed from the last time you committed, then commit your changes
